# Website
My website allows me to test a few things out with my family. It is made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also helps me refresh my JavaScript skills while I've been working with Java. 

# Events Tab
Parts of my website were completed very early on, such as requesting a password to view my google photos of certain events. I know it isn't secure, but I wanted to try out the alert with a response to move on to the next page. I want to go in and add a more secure way of keeping access to family only. Another issue that I encountered was that I tried to get my family to use the website as a way to share the photos we took at family events, but since it was free to setup, it wasn't very easy for them to remember the site address. They would visit one time, but they wouldn't favorite the site. Then, they forgot about it. 

# Games Tab
Under the games tab, I have also been working on different games in Canvas to get some experience with user interaction. My latest are the Bingo Card and Bingo Ball Generators. My family and I like to play games through Zoom while the Stay-At-Home orders are in place, and I kept seeing people playing bingo with real bingo cards and such online. I thought it would be good to play through a Zoom session as each player can get a bingo card and one player can be the caller. This game will be played during our next session.
