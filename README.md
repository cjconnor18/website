# Website
My website allows me to test a few things out with my family. It is made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also helps me refresh my JavaScript skills while I've been working with Java. 

# Events Tab
Parts of my website were very early on, such as requesting a password to view my google photos of certain events. I know it isn't secure, but I wanted to try out the alert with a response to move on to the next page. I tried to get my family to use the website as a way to share the photos we took at family events, but since it was free to setup, it wasn't very easy to remember the site address. 

# Games Tab
Under the games tab, I have also been working on different games in Canvas to get some experience with user interaction. My latest are the Bingo Card and Bingo Ball Generators. My family and I like to play games through Zoom while the Stay-At-Home orders are in place, and I kept seeing people playing bingo with real bingo cards and such online. I thought it would be good to play through a Zoom session as each player can get a bingo card and one player can be the caller. This game will be played during our next session.
