    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I created this page to share photos from different family events and to 
      advance my skills in creating websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
      please let me know if you have questions or if something isn't working
      correctly. I have included passwords to the different photo galleries to 
      limit access to those pictures, but the passwords are also given. </p>
